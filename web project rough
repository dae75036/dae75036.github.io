        <h3>Sweet 16 Trip to Puerto Rico</h3>
        <p>
            When I turned 16 my father took me back to the place I was born, Puerto Rico! Before going
            I was so excited because I had not been back since we moved away. I was only two when we moved
            so all I knew about Puerto Rico came from what my family had told me through stories they remembered.
            However, I knew that it was an island paradise that I would love too. </p>
        <p>
            I have always loved the beach so what could be better than an island? When we got there the first
            thing we did was go to our hotel. It was absolutely gorgeous and was shaped like a shell. The lobby
            was decorated with beautiful furniture and was open to the outside so the cool ocean breeze was always
            flowing. </p>
        <p>
            We stayed for a weekend, and while we were there we went on my adventures. This website contains
            pictures and the highlights of our trip. </p>
