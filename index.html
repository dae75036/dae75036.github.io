        <h1>Sweet 16 Trip to Puerto Rico</h1>
        <p>
            When I turned 16 my father took me back to the place I was born, <strong><ins>Puerto Rico!</ins></strong>Before going <br>
            I was so excited because I had not been back since we moved away. I was only two when we moved <br>
            so all I knew about Puerto Rico came from what my family had told me through stories they remembered.<br>
            However, I knew that it was an island paradise that I would love too. </p>
        <p>
            I have always loved the beach so what could be better than an island? When we got there the first<br>
            thing we did was go to our hotel. It was absolutely gorgeous and was shaped like a shell. The lobby<br>
            was decorated with beautiful furniture and was open to the outside so the cool ocean breeze was always
            flowing. </p>
        <p>
            We stayed for a weekend, and while we were there we went on my adventures.<br> <b>This website contains
            pictures and the highlights of our trip.</b></p>
